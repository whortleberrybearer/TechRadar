# TechRadar

My tech radar, this includes technologies that I use personally and commercially. 

The rings don't directly match to how ThoughtWorks use them as I am not actively recommending (or not so) the use of specific languages, tools, etc.  It is more an indication of technologies that I'm actively using, not using or wanting to understand more about.

- Adopt = I'm regularly using and well skilled in.
- Trail = I'm using / won't to start using and am looking to increase my knowledge in.
- Assess = I'm want to understand more about.
- Hold = I'm not actively using or should avoid using going forward.

As I'm including technologies I use commercially, relevant items and ones that I'm knowledgesable in may move to the outer rings as I'm no longer using them, e.g. Kubernetes is not used by my current company and I have no use for it personally, so I should focus my attention on more relevant technologies.
